We log onto the SEASNet server and create a new directory on the Desktop for 
this lab.

1. We use the command wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
to grab Coreutils 7.6. 

2. We notice that the file is archived, hence we first need to ’untar’ it. 
This is done by using the command tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz We then enter 
the coreutils-7.6 directory cd coreutils-7.6 and skim through INSTALL file for 
instructions. We then create a new directory test in the parent directory to 
compile and install the package: cd .. then mkdir test. Then we navigate back 
into coreutils-7.6 and as per instructions run the following commands: 
i) ./configure --prefix="/u/eng/class/classaja/Desktop/Assignment\ 3/test"
ii) make
iii) make install

3. locale is already set to en_US.UTF-8. We go on to inspect if the bug exists 
(while in test) by using the following commands: ls -l /bin/bash 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960616 2016-10-17 03:05 /bin/bash
We instantly  notice the buggy format in which the date is displayed.

4. In order to fix this bug we begin to implement Brady’s patch. For this we 
navigate to the src directory in coreutils-7.6 and begin editing ls.c using 
emacs ls.c. We modify the file in emacs manually by referring to Brady’s 
patch file provided to us.

5. We execute make in coreutils-7.6 and see the following output:

We notice that there is a lot of entering and leaving directories. The number 
of files being compiled here is much less than before since only ls.c was 
modified. the first line of output make all-recursive goes through all 
directories in coreutils-7.6 to check if they have been modified due to the 
patch. In the end only two directories were re-compiled src and man. And the 
rest of the commands displayed indicate that all directories were checked 
however only two were actually compiled again.

6. We check if the bug has been fixed by running the ls command in the two 
different directories that have the new and old coreutils-7.6 installed. 
 
i) ./test/bin/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 10013204 2017-01-27 16:23 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

ii) ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 10013204 Jan 27 16:23 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Now we make the coreutils file more than 1 year old: 
touch -t 1601231234 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

As done before, we test using (i) and (ii) as above. And we get the following 
outputs respectively:
 i) -rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 10013204 2016-01-23 12:34 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
ii) -rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 10013204 Jan 23 2016 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this is the desired format.
