Q1. Brady’s patch removed "case_long_iso_time_style:" because it was a label 
inside a switch-case block that was associated with a goto statement. It was 
not necessary to delete this line as the goto statement that was linked to this 
label was deleted. However, it can be considered an attempt to avoid 
redundancies in the code. 

Q2. The patched version of Coreutils can cause problems if the company has 
international transactions. People in different regions,  specially where 
english is not the native language, may have comprehend the date incorrectly. 
Also, certain applications or programs programmed to work with a specific date 
format, may produce erratic results on running with the patched version.

Q3. On executing python randline.py /dev/null we get the following output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This happens because we are passing an empty file (/dev/null) as an argument to 
the script. However, the script doesn’t know that the file is empty. It 
assumes that there is something in the file and attempts to access the elements 
in the file. Since there are 0 lines the index is essentially out of range. 
Also, as stated in the comment in line 274, IndexError occurs if seq is empty 
which is exactly the case here.

Q4. On executing python3 randline.py /dev/null we get the following output:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Note that we get a syntax error here. This is because python2 came equipped 
with automatic tuple unpacking however, python3 deprecated this functionality.
