Once we are logged onto the SEASNet server, we use the following command to download a version of coreutils: 
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

As before, we untar the directory by using tar -zxvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

In order to build coreutils we execute the following commands:
	./configure
	make

We get the following error:

In file included from utimecmp.c:41:0:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^
In file included from utimecmp.h:25:0,
                 from utimecmp.c:25:
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
 extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
            ^

Next we download the renaming patch using: 
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

Now we go on to patch coreutils and build it again using the following commands:
	patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
The following files get patched:
	patching file lib/utimens.c
	patching file lib/utimens.h
	patching file src/copy.c
	patching file src/tee.c
	patching file src/touch.c

We execute make and this time we do not get any errors since the renaming patch has been applied.

We begin to reproduce the problem and debug following the example provided on the assignment page:

We make a temporary directory using tmp=$(mktemp -d)
and navigate into it using cd $tmp
then we create three files to conduct our tests using commands:
	touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
	touch now
	sleep 1
	touch now1

and then we call on the buggy ls in the coreutils directory:
~/Assignment\ 4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

this gives us the following output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 1918-11-11 03:00:00.000000000 -0800 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 2017-02-10 15:10:50.366019726 -0800 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 2017-02-10 15:10:41.739788603 -0800 now

as we can see wwi-armistice is displayed first in the list which is opposite of what we desire. The problem has been successfully reproduced.

Now we employ GDB to debug ls:
gdb --args ~/Assignment\ 4/coreutils-with-bug/src/ls -lt wwi-armistice now now1

Once in GDB we execute (gdb) info functions which provides a list of functions. We see a number of functions related to comparing times, however we do not know which is the one relevant to our issue. 
So we set a breakpoint at function sort_files() and continue to debug:
	(gdb) run
we step into the function
	(gdb) s
and inspect the code where the function breaks
	(gdb) list
	(gdb) list
	(gdb) list
this displays the contents of the function sort_files(). We notice something of interest here. The function compare_mtime definitely has something to do with comparing times. We set another 
breakpoint:
	(gdb) break compare_mtime
the we step into the function using
	(gdb) si
which gives us the following output:
timespec_cmp (b=..., a=...) at ../lib/timespec.h:49
49	  return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
	(gdb)list
outputs to show details of timespec_cmp:
46	timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
47	{
48	  int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
49	  return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;
50	}

We instantly spot that the problem lies in line 48: a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec. If a.tv_sec is really small diff will be a very large negative value which will wrap around hindering accurate comparison.   

We build our patch file and implement it to a new coreutils. 

The file system used on SEASnet server and the tmp directory varies - SEASNet employs a 64 bit one where tmp uses a 32 bit. So when we recreate the bug locally we get the flowing output:
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 Dec 17  2054 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 Feb  9 10:51 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 classaja class 0 Feb  9 10:51 now

We see a future date which should not be happening. This occurs because the Unix Epoch counts seconds since 1970. This causes problems when Unix Epoch is added to the 64 bit displaying a future date.
