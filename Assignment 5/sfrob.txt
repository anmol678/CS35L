Comparison between sfrob and sfrobu:
lines		comparisons
10		34
100		4852
1000		23291		
10000		5664294
100000		62519357

this suggests that to estimate the number of comparisons as a function of the number of lines we can use nlogn.

Comparing the overall performance of sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs, sfrobu -f, and sfrobs -f:

time ./sfrob < test.txt
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.001s

time ./sfrobu < test.txt 
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.002s

time ./sfrobs < test.txt 
real	0m0.006s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.004s

time ./sfrobu -f < test.txt 
real	0m0.002s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.002s

time ./sfrobs -f < test.txt 
real	0m0.008s
user	0m0.002s
sys	0m0.005s

sfrob comes out to be the fastest as less system calls are made in comparison to sfrobu. We have already seen the results of similar comparisons made in the lab part of this assignment. sfrobu does 
not make use of buffers and literally reads one byte at a time from the file requiring more system calls and making execution slower.

The shell script sfrobs is the slowest of them all as suggested by the real time. This implies that the multiple pipings take longer to execute than sfrob and sfrobu.
