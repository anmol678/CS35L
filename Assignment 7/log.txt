We begin with booting Ubuntu using the CD provided to us.

Then we install relevant OpenSSH files using the following commands:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Once this is done, we begin to setup our server. First we generate keys using: 
ssh-keygen

I didn’t change the default location and didn’t enter any passkey for it.
Then I added my teammate Jason as a user using the following commands:
sudo user add -d /home/jason/ -m jason
sudo passwd jason
A new directory for user Jason was created with password jason.

Now we need to create an ssh directory in Jason’s folder and give him ownership so that he is able to log onto server. 
cd /home/jason
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R jason ..sh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Next we find the IP address using:
ifconfig
My IP address was 172.30.118.41

Jason performed the same steps and added me as a user on his server. His IP address was 172.27.64.161.

Now that everything was setup, all we had to do was act as clients for each other’s servers. We used the following commands:
ssh-copy-id -i anmol@172.27.64.161
ssh-add
This added my public key to the shh folder on the server. 

Everything worked okay till this point. I proceeded to log onto Jason’s server:
ssh -X anmol@172.27.64.161

Then I tested using xterm:
xterm
This opened an xterm shell window. 

Jason followed the same steps and we were able to see each other’s activities on our servers.
