2. We checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch called quote:
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. We run the patch command to patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt to patch the newly created branch quote and get the following output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4 & 5. To create a ChangeLog we follow the following steps:
emacs src/cmp.c
C-x 4 a
This adds the file to the ChangeLog as an entry. Then we add a description "Changed all occurrences of ` to '. No other changes made to the sourcecode."
We do this for all of the sex file mentioned above.

6. We stage all files that were patched and proceed to commit using the ChangeLog entry as the commit message:
git add .
git commit -aF ChangeLog

7. Next we create a patch file for our latest commit using:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

8. We checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch again. This time naming it partner:
git checkout v3.0 -b partner
Me and my partner Daniel exchanged patches andI verified his patch. I did this using scp daniil@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/CS35L/Assignment9/formatted-patch.txt .
Then I applied the patch using git am formatted-patch.txt. After this I executed make check to check that the system works. Thus his patch worked.

9. We execute command make distdir as instructed and this created a new directory diffutils-3.0.1-1049. We inspect ChangeLog inside this directory and it is indeed the same as we created a few steps earlier.

10. First we change directory using: cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. Then we execute gitk. A gitk window popped open. It would have been extremely hard to scroll down to commits dating 2015-01-25. So we quite gitk and execute another command to limit our results till the mentioned date: gitk --until=2015-01-25. This restricted the search to actions performed until 2015-01-25. Then it was easy to find the latest merge.
